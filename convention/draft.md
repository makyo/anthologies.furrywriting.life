### What

*Convention* is an anthology of furries --- the people with an interest in anthropomorphics, rather than their characters --- gathering for a furry con. The stories will be of all ratings and featuring folks of all types, all of whom are attending one (fictional) convention in Austin, TX, all experiencing the same events in different ways.

### Why

We as furries, the people in the embodied world, construct vast worlds in which our characters live. Yet we ourselves live interesting lives of our own. We interact with each other online, we meet up for cons and events, we have to live and work surrounded by folks without our particular interests.

There's stories to be told.
